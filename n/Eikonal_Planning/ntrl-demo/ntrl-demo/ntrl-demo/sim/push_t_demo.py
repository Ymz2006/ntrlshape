"""Push the T along an Eikonal-planner trajectory with a single cylindrical pusher.

The planner (``models/metric`` + ``Experiments/3dshape/.../latest.pt``) produces an SE(2)
path for the T itself -- it says nothing about a robot.  This demo closes that gap: it
takes the planned T path as a *reference* and solves, at every frame, the inverse problem
"where must the cylinder be so that the T moves the way the plan wants it to".

Three stages:

1. **Plan** (``plan_tee_path``).  Load the checkpoint, take one start/goal pair out of the
   test set, and run the planar MPPI rollout on the travel-time field.  Output is a
   (T, 3) array of SE(2) poses in the planner's normalized frame.

2. **Lift into the sim frame** (``planner_to_world``).  The planner works in
   ``(p - env_center) / env_scale`` on the *z-up* meshes and poses the shape about its
   bounding-box centre.  ``pymunk_viser_push`` works in raw mesh units on the *y-up*
   meshes mapped through MESH_TO_WORLD, and poses the T about its footprint *centroid*
   (the pymunk body origin).  Those two frames coincide up to the centroid offset --
   MESH_TO_WORLD is exactly the y-up -> z-up rotation -- so the lift is
   ``x_world = x_norm * env_scale + env_center`` plus ``R(theta) @ (centroid - bbox_centre)``.

3. **Discrete push primitives** (``PushPrimitives`` + ``PushController``).  An action is
   a (boundary point, push direction, push length) triple: put the cylinder behind that
   point and drive it straight for that far.  Every action in the library is MEASURED
   once by rolling it out in an empty arena, so the forward model is exact by
   construction -- the analytic quasi-static screw model over-predicts rotation about 9x
   and cannot place the object (see ``PushPrimitives.calibrate``).

   Choosing one is then an argmin: which action leaves the smallest residual pose error
   against the chunk of reference path ``--action-steps`` ahead.  Rotation enters that
   cost in length units via ``c``, the limit surface's length scale, which trades rotation
   against translation.  pymunk's top-down friction is a max-force / max-torque pair, so
   the sim's own anisotropy is ``spin_friction / friction``; that is the default, not the
   shape's radius of gyration.

   Searching the push LENGTH alongside the contact is what makes the last few actions
   converge: far from the goal the demand is a full chunk of path and a long push wins, and
   as the T closes in every long push overshoots, so the short end of the ladder wins on
   cost with no distance schedule to tune.

The loop is closed at two levels.  Per action, the next one is chosen from the T's measured
pose, so modelling error is corrected rather than accumulated.  Per few seconds, the
reference itself is re-planned from that pose (``Replanner``).

There are two modes, and they differ only in how the cylinder REACHES each action's entry
point: by default it is teleported there, which is free but unphysical, and under
``--teleport-interp`` it flies.  A flown transit is always three legs -- off the surface,
across, back down -- with no straight-line shortcut, and the middle leg has two forms.
Between two points standing off the SAME face of the footprint it is a slide along that
face, lifted clear of it; otherwise it is an arc about the object, and the arc's radius is
searched, the tightest circle clearing the shape and the environment winning, so the pusher
hugs the T where it can and swings out to the enclosing circle only where it must.

        The analytic ``predict`` is not good enough to plan with.  Measured against the
        simulator it over-predicts rotation by roughly 9x, and the measured rotation is
        near-constant in the push length (~5 deg at L = 10, 20 and 40 alike) rather than
        growing with it.  The reason is that the screw model assumes the body keeps turning
        under a constant body twist, whereas a rigid single-point push turns the object only
        until the contact normal lines up with the push direction and thereafter simply
        slides it.  Rank correlation stays high (+0.85), so the analytic model knows which
        primitives rotate more, but its magnitudes cannot place the object.

        So each primitive is rolled out once in an empty arena and the resulting body-frame
        delta is recorded.  Exact by construction, and it costs one short rollout per
        primitive, cached to disk against the parameters that affect it.

        A whole ladder of push lengths is measured, not just one.  Selection then picks the
        length as well as the contact, which is what lets the action shrink as the T closes
        on the goal: far away the demanded chunk of path is ~40 units and a long push wins;
        near the goal the demand is a couple of units and every long push overshoots it, so
        the short end of the ladder wins on cost with no distance schedule to tune.

        rungs of the radius ladder are perfectly capable of producing -- worse than any
        number of walls.  Burial is not a scrape: transit waypoints are body-frame, so a
        pusher inside the T shoves it, the target moves with it, and the leg never
        converges at all.

        The obstacle term is measured over the whole SWEPT path rather than its waypoints:
        at ``--arc-step`` degrees on a wide radius consecutive waypoints are further apart

          re-entry leg down to the hand-over point -- and it is pure travel, so the whole
          pusher DISC has to stay off the object: it is tested against ``no_sweep``, the T
          grown by that disc.  A circle inside the T's bounding radius, a slide hugging one
          face, or a re-entry aimed at a pose the disc cannot occupy can all be clear of
          the *polygon* and still drag the object along.  That is what ``_handover`` buys:

        the circle and mostly misses it entirely, so the preferred ray is the radial one:
        straight down to the nearest point of the circle.

        Either way the preference is only a preference, not an answer: the T is concave, so
        the normal out of a notch runs straight into the opposite arm, meets the circle on
        the far side, and leaves an approach leg that comes back down through the object.
        That is not merely a scrape.  Transit waypoints live in the T's body frame, so a
        pusher driving into the T shoves it, the target moves with it, and the leg never
        converges at all -- the pusher chases its own tail until something else interrupts.

        So the ray is TESTED, not assumed.  Directions are tried in order of angular
        distance from the preferred one, and the first whose whole leg clears the object is
        taken -- preferring legs that also keep the pusher disc clear, and settling for
        merely not passing through the object when no direction manages both.  When the
        preferred ray is already fine, which is the common case, nothing changes.

        """Where a flown transit ends: back along the PUSH line, clear of the object.

        The entry point itself is not a pose the pusher can fly to.  It is the contact
        backed off by ``pusher_radius + clearance`` along the push direction, and for a
        direction taken obliquely across the face -- most of the ``--dir-spread`` fan --
        that leaves the disc overlapping the T.  Teleporting into such a pose is fine,
        pymunk resolves the overlap in one step.  Flying to it cannot work at all: the
        approach presses the object before arriving, the waypoint is body-frame so the
        target moves away with the object, and the two settle into a fixed gap that never
        closes.  The pusher then shoves the T around for as long as the transit lasts,
        which is the whole point of a transit not happening.

        Backing off along the PUSH direction is the one retreat that costs nothing.
        ``final_local`` is ``entry_local`` advanced along that same direction, so a pusher
        standing further back on that line and driving to ``final`` executes the identical
        straight push -- it just spends more of it in free space first, exactly as the
        measured rollout does (it starts from ``pusher_radius + 2`` where the runtime uses
        ``pusher_radius + clearance``).  The push ends at a body-frame point either way, so
        the T still lands where the model says.

        So the retreat is ``--transit-approach`` at minimum, and as much further as it
        takes for the disc to clear -- the concave-pocket case a fixed retreat gets wrong.
        But only as far as ``--transit-reach``: a contact deep inside one of the T's
        notches needs tens of units, and retreating that far is not free after all.  The
        line back out of a notch runs ALONGSIDE the object, so the pusher scrapes the T for
        the whole approach -- measured on one such action, the disc was in contact for 107
        of its 110 frames -- and a nominally 5-unit push becomes a 77-unit drive.  Those
        contacts are simply not reachable by flying, and ``flyable`` drops them from the
        action set instead, which is honest where a long retreat is not.

        When the pusher and the next entry point stand off the SAME flat face of the

        the entire move happens against one face, and the arc's two normal legs are the

        are lifted off the face by the same ``--edge-lift`` along its outward normal, and
        the pusher slides between the lifted pair before coming back down to the entry
        point -- three legs still, but along the face instead of around the object.

        The lift is what makes the slide safe.  The pusher finishes a push pressed against
        the face, and an entry point taken obliquely across it stands less than a disc
        radius off it, so sliding at either point's own height would scrape the object
        along the way and shove it.  Lifting both by the same amount keeps the slide

        Waypoints are stored in the T's body frame and mapped to world every frame, so a
        T that gets nudged during the transit carries the remaining path with it.

        The last waypoint is not like the others.  It is the action's precondition -- the
        pose the push is measured from -- so it is held to ``--entry-tol`` rather than to
        ``--wp-tol``.  Sharing one tolerance meant it was popped the instant the pusher
        came within ``--wp-tol``, which at 20 units/s and the old 3.0 default was 2.7-3.0
        units EVERY time: the push then started that far off its own line, aimed at a fixed
        world point, so the disc met the object at a different place and angle than the
        primitive that was measured.  Converging properly costs one or two frames, because
        a kinematic body inside ``max_speed * dt`` of its target lands exactly on it in a
        single step.

The others are held to ``--wp-tol`` and cutting their corners is fine:
        it takes the pusher off the polyline ``_path_cost`` tested, but the leg that runs
        closest to the object is the re-entry, and both of its ends are now pinned -- the
        top by the arc it leaves, the bottom by ``--entry-tol``.

        The flight is bounded even so.  Nothing here can make the pusher reach a waypoint
        that runs away from it -- if the disc is pressing the object, the body-frame target
        moves with the object -- and orbiting until something else interrupts is worse than
        starting the push late.  So a transit gets a budget of three times its own length
        at the transit speed, plus a second; past that it is abandoned where it stands and
